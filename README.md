### Usage
1. Put the .zip in the Mods folder
2. Add a dependency to the DJMapHelper like so:
~~~
- Name: YourModName
  Version: 1.0.0 (Your mod's version)
  Dependencies:
    - Name: Everest
      Version: 1.808.0 (Everest version your mod runs on, at least 808)
    - Name: DJMapHelper
      Version: 1.0.0
~~~
3. Restart Ahorn for the entities and triggers list to update (You can use the debug dropdown if you have it enabled)
- Colorful Feather
- Colorful FeatherBarrier - Only go through if you're flying in the same color
- Colorful Refill: 
    - black: +dash -stamina or -dash +stamina. If no stamina and no dash, die.
    - blue: only +stamina
    - red: only +dash
- Climb Blocker Trigger - Completely banning interaction with walls means you can't wall jump and climb
- Temple Gate Reversed - Used for going from right to left
    - Changed the width of TheoGate: 16 -> 8

4. Compatibility features 
-  Crystal Theo were allowed into the bubble, as long as any one room name contains the word "allowTheoCrystalIntoBubble" to take effect on the entire map.
