# Usage
1. **Put the .zip in the Mods folder. If you're just playing with other maps that require this Helper, do only this.**

2. **If you want to include it in your map, add a dependency to the DJMapHelper like so:**

    ~~~yaml
    - Name: YourModName
      Version: 1.0.0 (Your mod's version)
      Dependencies:
        - Name: Everest
          Version: 1.808.0 (Everest version your mod runs on, at least 808)
        - Name: DJMapHelper
          Version: 1.0.0
    ~~~

3. **Restart Ahorn for the entities and triggers list to update**
